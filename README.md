# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This is a simple project done as part of EGR 598 AI and ML demonstrating prediction of risk of heart diease using three simple different models i.e. Logistic Regression,SVM,Decision Trees based on factors 'Age', 'Sex', 'ChestPainType', 'RestingBP', 'Cholesterol', 'FastingBS','RestingECG', 'MaxHR', 'ExerciseAngina', 'Oldpeak', 'ST_Slope','HeartDisease'. We also introuced the concept of causality based on the [paper](http://www.skleinberg.org/papers/uai09.pdf) to see if there's an improvement in accuracy for the data that has been processed using the techniques present in the paper
# Key Steps Performed
* Simple EDA
* Causal Analysis
* Model Training and Prediction
